## Common Issues & Fixes

### "Folder not found"
```
❌ Error: Directory not found: /Users/bajoris/path/to/folder

Fix:
- Copy the FULL path: /Users/username/folder/name
- Not just: folder/name
- Use ~ for home directory: ~/Downloads/folder
```

### "No images found in folder"
```
❌ Error: No images found in folder: 30005160-3232

Causes:
- Images have wrong extension (.PNG instead of .jpg)
- Folder is empty
- Folder named incorrectly (should be reference-color)

Fix:
- Verify images are .jpg, .jpeg, or .png
- Check folder structure: ~/folder/30005160-3232/image.jpg
- Run the copy script again to organize images
```

### Template ID is 0 (not found)
```
❌ Template ID: 0 (means not in catalog)

Causes:
- Reference-color not in catalog CSV
- Color code doesn't match (e.g., "3232" vs "03232")
- Catalog file was wrong

Fix:
- Check catalog has row: 30005160;3232;123456
- Verify color codes match exactly
- Upload correct catalog file
```
