- ⏱️ Time: ~2-3 hours

**With Image Matcher:**
- ✅ Automatic matching (2 minutes)
- ✅ Copy only ~200 relevant images (1 minute)
- ✅ Upload pre-matched images (10 minutes)
- ⏱️ Time: **~15 minutes**

**Time Saved: 87%** 🚀

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### **Future Improvements:**
1. **Auto-convert local images to data URLs**
   - Add server-side API to read files
   - Automatically embed images in import

2. **Batch upload**
   - Select folder instead of individual files
   - Auto-match based on filenames

3. **Image preview**
   - Show actual image thumbnails in Step 1.5
   - Use canvas/FileReader for local files

4. **Direct Odoo upload**
   - Upload images before import
   - Link by reference instead of embedding

5. **Multi-vendor support**
   - Extend matcher to other vendors
   - Configurable matching patterns

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Local file paths can't be previewed** in browser
   - Solution: Show filenames instead
   - Manual upload required

2. **Large images increase payload size**
   - Solution: Image compression before embed
   - Or upload separately to Odoo

3. **Session storage has size limits**
   - Solution: Store only references
   - Or use IndexedDB
